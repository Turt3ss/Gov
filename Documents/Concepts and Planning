1. Define your appâ€™s purpose and target audience

The app purpose is to have user use the app without the need of internet. The features would have all of the governmental
and non governmental officials services. The target audiences would be anyone living in Malaysia.
This project will be conducted and finished within this week. Also, I'm doing this out of spite for witnessing such humiliating IT crafts..

2. Research existing apps and identify gaps in the market

Government is the only publisher for this type of app

3. Develop a unique value proposition and competitive advantage

Unique value propsition and competitive advantage that this app can gave is being overall better, providing accurate data and
relevancy according to the user needs. The app would be free of charge, available in offline, secured from any data breach and having
a very strong and simple user friendly design.

4. Create a rough wireframe and user flow diagram
