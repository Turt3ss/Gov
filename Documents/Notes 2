1. Cut the development time by taking only the importants from details.

2. The app market has lots of similarities as this project and more experienced, well made so the only way to get a competetive advantage is by developing a unique value propostition.

3. Follow the best way to code efficiently and effectively as a solo developer.

 
To code efficiently and effectively, it’s essential to follow best practices that ensure your code is maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand. Based on the provided search results, here are some key takeaways:

1. Effectiveness: Ensure your code solves the problem it’s intended to solve. Test your implementation to verify it works as expected.

2. Efficiency: Optimize your code to minimize computational resources, such as memory and CPU usage. This can be achieved by:
Reusing existing code to reduce duplication and save time.
Implementing modular, reusable functions to avoid code repetition.
Using efficient algorithms and data structures.

3. Simplicity: Prioritize simplicity by:
Breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable pieces.
Using clear and concise variable names and function signatures.
Avoiding unnecessary complexity and minimizing dependencies.

4. Code Reusability: Design your code to be modular and reusable by:
Implementing functions that perform specific tasks and can be easily composed together.
Using polymorphism and abstraction to create flexible, adaptable code.
Documenting your code and its intended use to facilitate reuse.

5. Clear Flow of Execution: Ensure your code follows a logical structure by:
Using consistent indentation and whitespace.
Breaking up long functions or blocks into smaller, more manageable pieces.
Avoiding deep nesting and using early returns or conditional statements to simplify code flow.

6. Test-Driven Development: Write automated tests for your code to ensure it meets the required functionality and efficiency standards.
