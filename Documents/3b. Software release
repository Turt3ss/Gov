A software proposal is a document sent to a prospective client to present the value of a software product and clarify supporting services included with the contract, such as training and onboarding. Proposals sent with proposal software can include the terms of service and e-signatures so that—once accepted—the proposal acts as a binding contract between two parties.

The ideal format for a software proposal includes an overview of the client’s goals, the solution, and what sets the company apart.

While one software proposal will showcase only the features and customer support as in the solution section, another might include very detailed project phases for implementation and training.

Types of software proposals
The main types of software proposals are enterprise software proposals and SaaS proposals.

- Enterprise software proposals - Enterprise software caters to large companies and organizations. Implementation is far more complex, so these types of proposals tend to include not only details about the proposed solution but also rollout timelines and milestones and the scope of work for data integration or data onboarding.

- SaaS proposals - SaaS proposals, on the other hand, often only sell software access. There won’t be custom project deliverables. The SaaS proposal might include some details about customer support access, but there won’t be a ton of project management involved. These proposals are aimed at startups, solopreneurs, and small businesses.

Software development proposals are completely different. These software project proposals are for custom web app or mobile app development. The client will pay for the development process. Meanwhile, a software proposal (described in this guide) is designed for selling access to software that already exists and whatever custom services will help a client make the most of it.

A great proposal should be detailed, brief, and results-focused.

1. Enterprise software proposal example

For starters, it includes an Overview and Goals page that mentions the client’s business growth, and associated challenges. The page then offers a bulleted list of the solutions needed to address those issues.

This proposal also includes the project scope. The work is broken down into three main categories: enterprise application management, customer relationship management, and business intelligence. On the second page of the Scope of Services section, the proposal lists the software products included and gives an overview of the project timeline.

2. SaaS proposal example

A SaaS proposal is usually a lot simpler, because there’s typically less custom work involved.

This SaaS example offers a few lessons. The Why Us section includes the company’s beliefs, history, value proposition, and commitment to customer support in just a few short paragraphs. Use this as inspiration when crafting your own Why us page.

The What We Offer portion of the proposal does an excellent job of combining software features and business benefits together. Make sure to use this section of the proposal to spell out the results of using your software, not just the functionality.

This SaaS proposal example also includes a bright, on-brand pricing section with different options. Clients can select the best fit for their business, and then sign off on the subscription.

All in all, the proposal does an excellent job of selling the software in the company’s unique brand voice and distilling essential details into a single document.

How to prepare for writing a software proposal

Before you can write a proposal, you need first to understand the client’s business case for your software.

How to identify the clients’ needs

Asking the right questions is the most important part of any sales process. Client discovery always comes before writing a proposal.

Client discovery can be done in a single software demo or a series of sales calls, demos, and presentations with different stakeholders.

Here are some questions you might ask:

Why did you decide to book a demo of our software?

What is your team struggling with when it comes to [task or project]?

What are you currently using to manage [task or project]?

How does your team collaborate on [task or project]?

When demoing your software, pay attention to what features and customer stories they respond to the most. This can help you identify the client’s problems and goals.
