Acceptance testing is a critical phase in software development where the product is evaluated against its specified requirements to ensure it meets the customer’s expectations. Here’s an example:

Scenario: A banking application’s “Fund Transfer” feature

Acceptance Criteria:

1. User Authentication: The system verifies the user’s login credentials correctly.

2. Transfer Amount: The system allows the user to transfer a minimum of $10 and a maximum of $10,000.

3. Recipient Account: The system validates the recipient’s account number and ensures it exists in the system.

4. Transfer Confirmation: The system displays a confirmation message to the user after a successful transfer.

5. Transaction History: The system updates the user’s transaction history with the transferred amount and date.

Acceptance Test Case:

1. Test Case ID: FT-001 Test Case Description: Verify the “Fund Transfer” feature allows a user to transfer $500 to a valid recipient account. Test Steps:

a. Log in to the banking application with valid credentials. b. Navigate to the “Fund Transfer” page. c. Enter the recipient’s account number (verified to exist in the system). d. Enter the transfer amount ($500). e. Confirm the transaction details. f. Verify the confirmation message is displayed. g. Check the user’s transaction history for the transferred amount.

Expected Result: The system successfully transfers $500 to the recipient’s account, and the user’s transaction history is updated accordingly.

Acceptance Test Report:

Test Case ID: FT-001
Test Result: Pass
Test Description: Verified the “Fund Transfer” feature allows a user to transfer $500 to a valid recipient account.
Test Steps: [list the test steps above]
Observations: None

This example demonstrates a simple acceptance test case for a banking application’s “Fund Transfer” feature. In a real-world scenario, you would have multiple test cases covering various scenarios, such as invalid recipient account numbers, insufficient funds, or transfer amount limits.
