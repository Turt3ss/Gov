Iteration plan example:

Based on Agile principles, an iteration plan outlines the work to be completed during a specific timebox, typically 2-4 weeks. Hereâ€™s a simplified example:

Iteration 5 Plan

Iteration Dates: August 15 - August 29, 2024

Team Velocity: 120 story points (based on historical data)
Prioritized Backlog Items:
High Priority:
User Story 1: Enhance search functionality (20 story points)
User Story 2: Fix critical bug in login feature (15 story points)
Medium Priority:
User Story 3: Implement new reporting dashboard (30 story points)
User Story 4: Improve user interface for mobile devices (25 story points)

Task Breakdown:
User Story 1:
Task 1: Research search algorithms (5 story points)
Task 2: Implement search functionality (10 story points)
Task 3: Test and refine search functionality (5 story points)
User Story 2:
Task 1: Identify and reproduce bug (3 story points)
Task 2: Develop fix for bug (8 story points)
Task 3: Test and verify fix (4 story points)

Resource Allocation:
Developer 1: Tasks 1.1 (Research), 2.1 (Implement), and 3.1 (Test) for User Story 1
Developer 2: Tasks 1.2 (Identify and reproduce), 2.2 (Develop fix), and 3.2 (Test) for User Story 2
Developer 3: Tasks 1.3 (Implement), 2.3 (Test), and 3.3 (Test) for User Story 3 and 4

Acceptance Criteria:
Each task will have clear acceptance criteria defined
Tasks will be reviewed and approved by the Product Owner before moving to the next stage

This example demonstrates a basic iteration plan, outlining the work to be completed, task breakdown, resource allocation, and acceptance criteria. Note that this is a simplified example and actual iteration plans may vary depending on the specific project and team requirements.

Iteration plan (My own):

From what I understand..

1. Iteration Dates: [Beginning] - [End]
2. Team Velocity: [Total Story Points]
 - High priority: [User Story #][Story Points]
 - Mid priority: [User Story #][Story Points]
 - Low priority: [User Story #][Story Points]
3. Task Breakdown:
 - [User Story #]
  - [Task Story #][Story Points]
4. Resource Allocation:
 - Developer #: Task # (Research), # (Implement) and # (Test) for User Story #
5. Acceptance Criteria:
