Kent Beck, the developer of Extreme Programming (XP), acknowledges the importance of customer involvement in the software development process. He emphasizes that XP is not just about writing code, but about delivering a working product that meets the customer’s needs. Beck’s approach focuses on “customer satisfaction” and “working software” as the primary goals.

Acknowledgement of Iteration

XP practitioners acknowledge the value of iteration in software development. They recognize that requirements can change, and that it’s essential to incorporate feedback and adapt the development process accordingly. This is reflected in the “Mea Culpa” ceremony, where the team reviews progress, identifies mistakes, and adjusts the plan for the next iteration.

Acknowledgement of Team Ownership

XP emphasizes team ownership and empowerment. Developers acknowledge that they are responsible for delivering the working software and are encouraged to take ownership of the project. This leads to a sense of accountability and motivation among team members, as they work together to deliver a high-quality product.

Acknowledgement of Best Practices

XP practitioners acknowledge that many best practices, such as test-first development and continuous integration, have been around for some time. They take these practices to an “extreme” level, applying them consistently throughout the development process to ensure high-quality software.

These acknowledgements demonstrate Kent Beck’s and XP’s commitment to delivering working software that meets customer needs, while also emphasizing the importance of iteration, team ownership, and best practices in software development.
