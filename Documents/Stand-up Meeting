In Extreme Programming (XP), the daily stand-up meeting, also known as the “stand-up,” is a crucial practice aimed at promoting team communication, problem-solving, and focus. Here’s an example of how it works:

Format: The meeting typically takes place every morning, with all team members standing in a circle.

Purpose: To share information, discuss problems and solutions, and align the team’s focus for the day.

Agenda:
Each team member shares:
What they worked on the previous day
What they plan to work on today
Any obstacles or issues they’re facing
The team listens actively and provides support or guidance as needed

Key principles:

Keep it brief: Meetings should be short and concise, typically lasting around 15-30 minutes.

No long discussions: The goal is to avoid in-depth discussions and instead focus on quick updates and next steps.

Everyone participates: Each team member is expected to contribute, ensuring everyone is informed and engaged.


By following this example, XP teams can:

Enhance information sharing and collaboration
Identify and address potential roadblocks early on

Foster a sense of unity and shared responsibility

Stay focused on project goals and priorities

Remember, the daily stand-up meeting is a vital component of XP’s “whole team” practice, promoting a culture of open communication, mutual support, and collective success.
