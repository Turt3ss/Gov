Citing References in Software Engineering Documentation
In a software engineering project, references are crucial for documenting and crediting the sources used in the development process. Here are some guidelines for writing references:

Book References:
Author(s) Last Name, Initial(s). (Year). Book Title. Publisher.
Example: Pressman, R. S. (1997). Software Engineering: A Practitioner’s Approach. McGraw-Hill.
Journal References:
Author(s) Last Name, Initial(s). (Year). Article Title. Journal Name, Volume(Issue), pp. Page Numbers.
Example: Bernus, P., & Nemes, L. (1996). A framework to define a generic enterprise reference architecture and methodology. Computer Integrated Manufacturing Systems, 9(3), 179-191.
Conference Proceedings References:
Author(s) Last Name, Initial(s). (Year). Paper Title. Conference Name, Location, pp. Page Numbers.
Example: Henry, E., & Faller, B. (1995). Large-scale industrial reuse to reduce cost and cycle time. Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Software Engineering, Seattle, WA, pp. 47-53.
Online References:
Author(s) Last Name, Initial(s). (Year). Article Title. URL (Date of Access).
Example: Infragistics. (2003). Expense Application - Reference Application. Retrieved from http://www.infragistics.com/products/thinreference.asp (accessed on August 31, 2024).
Design Pattern References:
Pattern Name (Year). Description. Source (e.g., book, article, website).
Example: Brooks, F. P. J. (1995). No Silver Bullet: Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering. Addison-Wesley.
General Guidelines:

Use a consistent citation style throughout the project.
Include all authors’ names, even if there are multiple authors.
Use the title of the book, article, or conference proceeding as it appears on the source material.
Provide the publication date, volume, issue, and page numbers when available.
For online sources, include the URL and date of access.
Verify the accuracy of the references and ensure they are properly formatted.
By following these guidelines, you can ensure that your references are clear, concise, and easily accessible, making it easier for others to build upon your work.
