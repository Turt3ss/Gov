Code documentation is essential for explaining how a piece of code works, what it does, and how to use it. Here are some examples:

1. Inline Comments: Brief notes that describe what a line or block of code means or does. They live exclusively in source code files and are invisible to compilers and browsers.

Example in JavaScript:
// Calculate the total cost
const totalCost = quantity * price;

2. Multi-line Code Comments: Longer explanations of implementation decisions behind a piece of code.

Example in JavaScript:
/**
 * Calculate the total cost, taking into account taxes and discounts
 * Formula: totalCost = quantity * price + (quantity * price * taxRate) - discountAmount
 */
const totalCost = quantity * price + (quantity * price * taxRate) - discountAmount;

3. README File: A document that provides an overview of the code, its purpose, and how to use it.

Example in (README.md)
# MyJavaScriptLibrary
A simple library for calculating total costs, including taxes and discounts.

## Usage
1. Import the library: `const myLibrary = require('my-javascript-library');`
2. Calculate the total cost: `const totalCost = myLibrary.calculateTotalCost(quantity, price, taxRate, discountAmount);`

## API Documentation
See [API.md](API.md) for detailed documentation of the library's functions and methods.

4. UX Design Documentation: Documents that explain user personas, user story maps, user scenarios, and UX style guides.

Example (UX Design Documentations)
**User Persona**: The "Busy Shopper" prioritizes convenience and speed when making purchases online.

**User Story Map**: As a Busy Shopper, I want to easily calculate the total cost of my order, including taxes and discounts, so that I can make informed purchasing decisions.

**UX Style Guide**: Use a clean and simple design, with clear typography and concise language, to ensure a seamless user experience.
