Predictive Maintenance of Software Exceptions
Based on the analysis of relevant information, the following exceptions should be predicted and considered in software engineering projects:

Inadequate estimation models: Formal estimation models not tailored to a particular organization’s own context may be inaccurate. Using own historical data is crucial to ensure estimation model relationships are based on similar project contexts.
Uncertainty in predictions: The software industry’s track record of success with predictions is dismal, with 60-70% of projects delivered over-budget, over-schedule, or canceled. This highlights the need to accept uncertainty and improve results with learning-based approaches.
Unforeseen project complexities: Projects often encounter unknowns that derail plans, even after considerable sums have been spent. A general framework for exceptions should account for these unexpected complexities.
Inadequate exception handling: Insufficient exception handling can lead to issues like:
Invalid input or parameters: Exceptions arising from incorrect or missing input data.
Internal errors: Exceptions caused by software bugs or internal system failures.
External factors: Exceptions triggered by external events, such as network issues or hardware failures.
Changing requirements and new exceptions: As colleagues introduce new features or changes, new exceptions may arise, making it essential to have a flexible exception handling framework that can adapt to these changes.
Communication and user-friendly error messages: Exceptions should be designed to provide informative and user-friendly error messages for both administrators and end-users, enabling effective issue resolution and minimizing downtime.
By anticipating and planning for these exceptions, software engineering projects can better mitigate risks, improve resilience, and ensure successful delivery.
