Crafting Acknowledgement Statements
Based on the provided search results, here are some general guidelines and examples on how to write an acknowledgement:

When you have nothing to acknowledge:

If a journal requires an acknowledgement section but you have nothing to acknowledge, you can:
Write a brief statement indicating that you have received no external funding or support (e.g., “This research has received no external funding”).
Simply respond to the editor that you will not be including an acknowledgement section, as it is optional.
If you’re writing a book, you can skip the acknowledgement section or keep it brief, acknowledging only essential contributors.
When you have contributors to acknowledge:

Approach the acknowledgement section as a message to the people you’re thanking, not about yourself.
Make it sincere and meaningful, highlighting the specific contributions each person made.
Use a formal tone, adhering to ethical guidelines.
Consider tailoring acknowledgments to the nature of the research, relationships involved, or the type of project (e.g., academic paper, book, or assignment).
Keep it concise, but not too brief. Aim for a few paragraphs or a page at most.
