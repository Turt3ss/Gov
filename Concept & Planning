1. Define your appâ€™s purpose and target audience

2. Research existing apps and identify gaps in the market

3. Develop a unique value proposition and competitive advantage

4. Create a rough wireframe and user flow diagram



The purpose of this offline mobile app is to provide user with helpful information about government official agency and non government official agency services.

There isn't a lot of quality in the app market and some of the most used ones are outdated, bugged and worst case misinformed.

This app will have all of the GO and NGO listed   and references according to its legitimate respective websites.

This project will be conducted and finished within this week. Also, I'm doing this out of spite for witnessing such humiliating IT crafts..
