Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Methodology: Kanban Style Scheduling

KSS - a visual scheduling system that helps manage work by limiting work-in-progress (WIP) and focusing on continuous flow.

1. Visualize Work:
Represent tasks as cards on a board, enabling transparent progress tracking and swift identification of bottlenecks.

2. Limit Work-in-Progress (WIP):
Establish upper limits on the amount of work in each stage to avoid overcapacity and optimize resource allocation.

3. Focus on Flow:
Prioritize continuous flow over batch processing, ensuring a steady workflow and minimizing inventory buildup.

4. Pull-Based Production:
Produce and deliver work based on demand, rather than pushing work through the system based on capacity.

Components

1. Kanban board:
A physical or digital board with columns representing different stages of work (e.g., To-Do, In-Progress, Done).

2. Cards:
Represent individual tasks or work items, each with its own status and WIP limit.

3. WIP Limits:
Establish maximum quantities for each stage to regulate workflow and prevent overloading.

4. Signals:
Cards or signals indicating when to start or stop work, such as “Signal” Kanban cards for stock replenishment or “Withdrawal” cards for container movement.

Benefits

1. Improved Flow:
Reduced lead times, increased productivity, and enhanced responsiveness to changing demand.

2. Increased Transparency:
Clear visibility into work status, enabling teams to identify and address bottlenecks.

3. Reduced Inventory:
Minimized WIP and inventory levels, reducing costs and improving quality.

4. Flexibility:
Kanban adapts to changing requirements and priorities, allowing for agile response to shifting market conditions.

Tools and Software:

1. Trello:
Popular Kanban app with customizable boards, lists, and cards.

2. Microsoft Planner:
A Kanban-style project management tool integrated with Microsoft Office 365.

3. Asana:
A work management platform with Kanban boards and workflows.

4. Custom built Kanban Board:
Many organizations create their own Kanban boards using whiteboards, sticky notes, or digital tools.

Implementation Tips:

1. Start Small:

Begin with a simple Kanban board and gradually add complexity as the team becomes familiar with the system.

2. Define WIP Limits:

Establish realistic WIP limits based on team capacity and workflow requirements.

3. Monitor and Adjusts:

Regularly review board performance, adjust WIP limits, and refine processes to optimize flow.

4. Train and Engage:

Educate team members on Kanban principles and involve them in the implementation process to ensure buy-in and adoption.
